## About The Project



## My inspiration

Check out my <a href='https://cormacsi.github.io'>web-site</a>. It's awesome.

Rick Astley is my hero. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'>That's</a> why.

_"There’s a fire and it burns so bright<br>
In every one of us, every one of us<br>
There’s a flame<br>
It’s our guiding light<br>
In every one of us, every one of us<br>
Every one of us"<br>_
                - Rick Astley

“Never Gonna Give You Up” was a global smash on its release in July 1987, topping the charts in 25 countries including Rick’s native UK and the US Billboard Hot 100.  It also won the Brit Award for Best single in 1988. Stock Aitken and Waterman wrote and produced the track which was the lead-off single and lead track from Rick’s debut LP “Whenever You Need Somebody”.  The album was itself a UK number one and would go on to sell over 15 million copies worldwide.

## Gratitude

First of all I would like to gratitude all my family and friends for `support`, `faith` and `encouragement`. You are the best, love you.

In addition, I want to express my gratitude to the school and fellow students who worked on projects with me and studied possibilities of computer science encouraging each other in our lowest moments. Thank you, guys. You are **greatly appreciated**.
